  'Maybe I can explain a little better. Its funny when you divide 1001 by 8, It brings up the decimal number first,
  then continue to divide by the same number to bring up the floating point number.
  
  1.9xxxxx are floats.
  15.xxxxx are decimals. (sometimes are floats. Not 100% sure yet.)

^ Again, the number: 0.125125 is a hundred-thousandth decimal place, and 125.25 is the tenth decimal place. 
not a float unless you divide the same number over again to get a floating point number.

This is different btw. It cannot be 0.125.25 in tenth decimal place because it has two decimals in the number which is not permitted in that type.
You will recieve a syntax error if you use that number with two decimals to divide the same number.
